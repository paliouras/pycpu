# pycpu

Code for the pyCPU simulator. 
Conceived as a tool in the study of basic microprocessor concepts
in the context of an introductory course to computers, using Python.

start demoCPU.py
It loads pycpu assembly stored in assembly.txt

Experiment by modifying the code.

Practice your python skills by, for example, adding some 
file-explore-style functionality to read assembly files, etc.

Several people have contributed to this project (TBA).
